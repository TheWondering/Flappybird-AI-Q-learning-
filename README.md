In this project, I used Q-learning to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird. The agent learns to navigate the game by receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. 
Over time, it updates its Q-values to improve its strategy for avoiding obstacles and staying airborne. The project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied to develop a game-playing agent that becomes increasingly skilled through trial and error.
